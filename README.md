# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz is one of the common interview question for the Computer Programmer.

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by three with the word "fizz", and any number divisible by five with the word "buzz".

#Play

Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn. However, any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible by five by the word buzz. Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz. A player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.

For example, a typical round of fizz buzz would start as follows:


1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...

#Variations

This section possibly contains original research. Please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations. Statements consisting only of original research should be removed. 

Different divisors can be used in place of, or in addition to, 3 and 5, and different words or gestures can replace "fizz" or "buzz". For example, in Australia a variant based on the game of cricket is played. In this variant, the special numbers are 4 and 6, which are replaced with the cricket umpiring gestures for their respective scoring plays. A common version of the game is also called "7 Boom". The players replace every number divisible by 7 or containing the digit 7 with "boom".

Instead of replacing numbers that have 3 or 5 as a factor, the game can be played by replacing numbers containing the digit 3 or 5 with "fizz" or "buzz".


1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, Fizz, 14, Buzz, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, Fizz, 24, Buzz, 26, 27, 28, 29, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz Buzz, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz, 40, 41, 42, Fizz, 44, Buzz, ...

In these variations, sometimes only the actual digit is replaced, so 23 becomes "twenty-fizz" and 50 is "buzzty". This variation can be combined with the original to form an even more challenging sequence:


1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, Fizz, 14, Fizz Buzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, Fizz, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, Fizz Buzz, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz Buzz, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz, Fizz, Buzz, 41, Fizz, Fizz, 44, Fizz Buzz, ...

The game can be played in a mathematical base other than 10. For example, playing in base 5 would proceed as follows:


1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 12, 13, Fizz, Buzz, 21, Fizz, 23, 24, Fizz Buzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, ...
